This system is being developed to make it easier for companies that want to use OSS to identify the licenses and vulnerabilities of the OSS that they plan on using.

We expect to see more companies using more OSS because our system will eliminate any doubts they have about whether an OSS will be helpful or harmful to their company.

Our system will make it easier for the OSS community to identify flaws, making it easier for them to fix them.
